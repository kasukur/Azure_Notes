AZ-900 Notes
============

1. Introduction
------------------

2. Cloud Concepts
------------------
* Language of Cloud Computing: 
		- High availability, Fault Tolerance, Disaster Recovery: Describe how stable and dependable cloud computing is.
		- Scalability, Elasticity and Agility: Ability to adapt changes in resource demand, user base and application usage.

* Language of Cloud Economics: CapEx and OpEx

* Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. 
  The Shared service model dictates whether you or Microsoft is responsible for a cloud service.

* Azure Marketplace: An extra layer of functionality for your cloud applications, by letting users use and integrate third-party products and services

* Cloud Architecture Models: Private, Public and Hybrid.


3. Azure Architecture
----------------------

* Regions and Availability Zones: 
	- Each region has more than one data center, which is a physical location.
	- Latency defined parameter: Latency is the time it takes data to travel. Also means that datacenters are not "too far" from each other.
  - Regional low-latency network: A fiber connection between data centers in the region.
	- Paired Region: Each region is paired within same geographic area except Brazil South.
	- Outage Failover: If the primary region has an outage you can failover to the secondary region.
	- Planned Updates: Only one region in a pair is updated at any one time.
	
* Availability Zones:
	- Each AZ is a physical location within a region.
	- Each AZ has its own power, cooling and networking.
	- Each region has a minimun of three AZ's.
	
* Resource Groups:
	- All resources belong to a resource group, which is not actually a resource. Think of it like a container that holds related resources.
	- One Resource: Each resource can only exist in a single resource group.
	- Add/Remove: You can add or remove resources to any resource group at any time.
	- Move Resource: You can move a resource from one resource group to another.
	- Multiple Regions: Resources from multiple regions can be in one resource group.
	- Access Control: You can give users access to a resource group and everything in it.
	- Interact: Resources can interact with other resources in different resource groups.
	- Location: A resource group has a location, or region, as it stores meta data about the resources in it.

		Azure Resource Manager (ARM):
			- All interactions with Azure resources go through ARM. It is the main Azure Architecture component for creating, updating and manipulating resources.
			
			Benefits:
				- Group Resource Handling: You can deploy, manage and monitor resources as a group.
				- Consistency: Deploying resources from various tools will always result in the same consistent state.
				- Dependencies: Define dependencies between resources to make sure they don't get in a fight.
				- Access Control: Built-in features in the ARM make it easy to assign access rights to users.
				- Tagging: Tag resources to easily identify them for future scenarios. Tagging is a way to label individual resources.
				- Billing: Use tagging to stay on top of the billing for groups of resources

4. Compute
----------
 * Virtual Machines (Exam Tips)
 	 - A VM is your machine exclusively
	 - You don't buy, own or control any hardware, Azure does this.
	 - VM's are an IaaS offering, where you are responsible for the entire machine.
	 - Azure virtual machines take advantage of Azure tools.
	 - Pricing goes up as resources go up, and you pay by the hour.
	 
 * Scale Sets (Exam Tips)
 	 - A group of identical, load balanced VMs.
	 - Scale sets are identical VMs. They can be activated or deactivated as needed.
	 - As resource usage increases, more VMs are activated to take the lead.
	 - You only pay for the VM, storage and networking resources you use. Nothing additional cost for Scale Sets
	 
 * App Services is an easy way to host and manage your web application. They are a PaaS offering on Azure. (Exam Tips)
   - Web Apps are used to host web sites and web applications
	 - Web Apps for Containers can host your existing container images.
	 - API Apps can host your data backend services. 	 
 
  * Azure Container Services
	 - Hosts and run your containers on Azure
	 - Containers have less overhead than Vm's and can be deployed consistently.
 
  * Azure Kubernetes Services
	 - Open-source tool for orchestrating and managing many container images and applications.
	 - Uses clusters and pods to scale and deploy applications.
 
 * Windows Virtual Desktop
   - 100% virtualised Windows 10.
	 - Access with any device that has a browser and internet connection.
	 - Reuse licenses

 * Functions
   - Serverless Azure offering.
	 - A function does one compute action each time it is invoked. 
 
5. Networking
-------------
 * Virtual Network (Exam Tips)
   - A virtual network is a range if IP addresses you can use for your resources.
	 - A subnet is a smaller network, which is part of your VNet. Use these for security and logical division of resources.
	 - A VNet is in a single region and single subscription.
	 - A VNet in the cloud can scale, have high availability and isolation.
	 
 * Load Balancer
   - Inbound Flows: Traffic from the Internet or local network
	 - Frontend: The access point for the load balancer. All traffic goes here first
	 - Backend Pool: The VM instances receiving traffic.
	 - Rules & Health Probes: Checks to ensure backend instance can receive the data.

	 - Scenarios
	 		- Internet Traffic: Balance the load of incoming Internet traffic into a system or application.
			- Internal Traffic: A load balancer works well with internal applications.
			- Port Forwarding: Traffic can be forwarded to a specific machine in the backend pool.
			- Outbound Traffic: Allow outbound connectivity for backend pool VMs.

 * VPN Gateway
   - Main components (Site-to-Site Connection)
	 			1. Azure VNet with VPN Gateway
				2. Tunnel
				3. On-Premises network with a complimentary gateway
	 - we can also have Multi-Site Connection with more than one customer gateways
	 
	 VPN Gateways are instrumental in a hybrid cloud architecture (Exam tips)
	 - A VPN Gateway is a specific VNet Gateway. It consists of two or more dedicated VMs.
	 - VNet Gateways + "VPN" becomes a VPN Gateway.
	 - Sends encrypted data between Azure and on premises network.
	 - 3 parts for VPN Gateways: Azure Gateway Subnet, Secure tunnel and on-premises gateway makes up a VPN Gateway scenario.
	  
 * Application Gateway
   - An Application Gateway is a higher level load balancer
	 - It works on the HTTP request of the traffic, instead of the IP address and port.
	 - Traffic from a specific web address can go to a specific machine.
	 - Is a fit for most other Azure services.
	 - Supports auto-scaling, end-to-end encryption, zone redundancy and multi-site hosting.
	 
 * Content Delivery Network
   - Origin and Edge location (Cache)
	 
 * ExpressRoute (AWS DirectConnect)
   - Private, Secure, high bandwidth and low latency connect from On-premises to Azure

6. Storage
-------------
   - Storage Account=Unique Azure Namespace 
	 
 * Blob (Binary Large Object)
 		
		Blob Types
		 - Block: 	Store text and binary data up to 4.7TB. Made up of individually managed blocks of data.
		 - Append: 	Block blobs that are optimised for append operation. Works well for logging where data is constantly appended.
		 - Page: 		Store files up to 8TB. Any part of the file could be accessed at any time, for example a virtual hard drive.
 
 		Pricing Tiers
			- Hot: 			Frequently accessed files, lower access times and higher access costs
			- Cool: 		Lower storage costs and higher access times. Data remains here for at least 30 days.
			- Archive: 	Lowest costs and highest access times.
			
 * Disk
 		 Managed Disk
		 1. Azure manages backup and uptime.
		 2. Microsoft and Azure guarantees size and performance as per SLA
		 3. Easy to upgrade disk size and type
		 
	 	 Disk Types	 
  	 - HDD: 					Spinning Hard drive, Low cost and suitable for backups 
		 - Standard SSD:	Standard for production, higher reliability, scalability and lower latency over HDD
		 - Premium SSD:		Super fast and high performance. Very low latency. Use for critical workloads.
		 - Ultra Disk:		For the most demanding, data-intensive workloads. Disks up to 64TB.
	 
 * File
   - File storage for Hybrid & Lift and Shift
	  
 * Archive
   - Requirement: Policies, legislation and recovery can be requirements for archiving data. These can be very large amounts of data.
	 - Lowest price: The archive tier is the lowest price for storage on Azure. A few dollars a month can get you terabytes of space.
	 - Free Up Premium Storage: With cheap archive storage you can free up your more premium on-premises storage.
	 - Secure: Fully secure to allow any personal data such as financial records, medical data and more.
	 - Features: Durable, encrypted and stable. Perfectly suited for data that is accessed infrequently
